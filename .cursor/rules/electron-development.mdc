# Electron Development
- All electron files are in the src directory
- The src directory is the only place any electron code files should go
- Electron configuration files should be in the root of the project
- An electron directory should never be created
- index.ts, preload.ts, and renderer.ts are the electron files. If more are needed just add them to the root of the src/ directory
